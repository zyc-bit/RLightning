## What is RLightning?

RLightning is a reinforcement learning framework designed for embodied intelligence — from humanoid locomotion to robotic manipulation. Its core principle is "prototype locally, scale seamlessly": researchers develop and debug algorithms in a standard single-process workflow, then scale to distributed multi-node, multi-GPU training by changing only a config file, with zero code modifications. 

## Core Design

**Unified Programming Interface** — A transparent runtime adaptation layer unifies the programming interface across single-process and distributed execution, enabling zero-code migration from local prototype to multi-node cluster.

**Decoupled Control and Data Planes** — Researchers orchestrate coarse-grained workflows through the control engine, while the underlying data plane handles inter-node data transfer and task scheduling via asynchronous I/O and pipelining, maximizing throughput without exposing distributed complexity.

**Fine-Grained Resource Management** — Independent scaling of compute modules with flexible co-location and scheduling strategies. GPU-level process co-location minimizes communication overhead for high-frequency interactions, while dynamic on/offloading enables compute reuse for sequential components.

**Modular Heterogeneous Ecosystem Integration** — Loosely coupled modular design enables standardized integration of mainstream simulators (IsaacLab, MuJoCo, ManiSkill), real robot hardware, and classic algorithm libraries (RSL-RL) through extensible interfaces.

## Performance Highlights

**Up to 15x throughput scaling** - Humanoid whole-body control training scales from single GPU to 64 GPUs (8 nodes) with configuration changes only, achieving up to 15x data throughput improvement. Asynchronous I/O and pipeline optimizations deliver 3.75x additional throughput gain at 8-node scale.

**30%+ throughput improvement on VLA tasks** — On compute-intensive OpenVLA RL tasks, RLightning improves training throughput by over 30% compared to baselines while maintaining identical convergence curves with no loss in accuracy.

## Build Your Own Algorithm

Start from the template and implement your custom policy:

```bash
cp -r examples/algorithm_template/ /path/to/your/project
cd /path/to/your/project && uv sync
```

A minimal `train.py` like:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from rlightning.utils.config import MainConfig
from rlightning.utils.launch import launch
from rlightning.utils.builders import (
    build_env_group, build_policy_group, build_data_buffer, build_engine
)

def main(config: MainConfig):
    env_group = build_env_group(config.env)
    policy_group = build_policy_group(config.policy.type, config.policy, config.cluster)
    buffer = build_data_buffer(config.buffer.type, config.buffer)
    engine = build_engine(config, env_group, policy_group, buffer)
    engine.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    launch(main_func=main, config_path=Path(__file__).parent / "conf")
```

Subclass `BasePolicy`, implement `rollout()` and `learn()`, register with `@POLICY.register("my_algo")`, and launch with `bash launch_train.sh`.
